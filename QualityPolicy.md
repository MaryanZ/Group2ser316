### Quality Policy
- Code Review: All changes must go through code review before being merged into the main branch to ensure quality, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
- Testing: Code changes should include tests to validate functionality and prevent regressions. This can include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as appropriate for the project.
- Linting and Formatting: Code should adhere to coding style guidelines and be consistently formatted. This can be enforced using linters and code formatters.
- Documentation: Code changes should include appropriate documentation, such as inline comments, README files, and API documentation, to make the codebase understandable and maintainable.
- Issue and Pull Request Templates: Contributors should use standardized templates when opening issues or pull requests to provide necessary information and context for review.
- Branching Strategy: A clear branching strategy, such as GitFlow or GitHub Flow, should be followed to manage code changes effectively and minimize conflicts.
- Dependency Management: Dependencies should be managed carefully, and updates should be reviewed and tested to prevent compatibility issues or security vulnerabilities.
- Continuous Integration (CI): Changes should be automatically tested using a CI system, and builds should pass all tests before being merged.
- Security Practices: Security vulnerabilities should be promptly addressed, and best practices for secure coding and handling of sensitive data should be followed.
- License: Projects should include a clear license file specifying the terms under which the code is available for use, modification, and redistribution.

  > Include a checklist/questions list which every developer will need to fill out/answe when creating a Pull Request to the Dev branch. 

  > Include a checklist/question list which every reviewer will need to fill out/anser when conducting a review, this checklist (and the answers of course) need to be put into the Pull Request review.
