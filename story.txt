Story:
- Once upon a time, at the bustling Raesfeld Flughafen, a curious tourist named Mehlhase decided to embark on a quest to taste every Bratwurst in Berlin before his return flight.
- The road to the Flughafen is the Hauptstrasse, where people can cycle, jog and walk their Hund.
- As Mehlhase made his way down the Hauptstrasse, he couldn't resist stopping at a local Baeckerei to buy some freshly baked Brot for his journey.
- Continuing down Hauptstrasse, Mehlhase discovered a Biergarten by an old Schloss, where a lively contest at the Ratskeller challenged participants to create the wildest bratwurst flavors, ranging from Apfelkuchen to Doener spice.
I see a lot of travellers rushing down the road to the airport in their cars. Those that drive BMW or Porsche must use the Klimaanlage.
